## Data

The project relies on static data from
[Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) and
[Understat](https://understat.com/). There is a script to pull the data from the
those sources in this project. By default, the script will get the data one page
at a time to avoid too much workload on those sources. So please be mindful with
the set up if you are going to use it.
