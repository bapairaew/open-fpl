          is not really real-time but it is quite close though - match results
          and player points are updated every minute while, unfortunately, ranks
          are only updated after matches finished. This is mostly due to some
          technical limitation which keeps Open FPL free and open to everyone.
          However, Open FPL will keep improving and maybe one day it will truly
          be "live" while still free.

          Anyway, the objective of this page is to give you a quick overview of
          the current and future FPL Gameweeks. It packs with the information
          that you would want to know about the ongoing matches - e.g. score,
          and player points, automatically updated without refreshing the page.
          It also shows you the fixtures of next gameweek, deadline and
          gameweek's top transfers to help you follow the current trend.
